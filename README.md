# Expression-Tree

Create a Binary Expressions Tree Class and create a menu driven program 

your program should be able to read multiple expressions from a file and create  expression trees for each expression, one at a time
the expression in the file must be in "math" notation, for example  x+y*a/b. 
display the preorder traversal of a binary tree as a sequence of strings each separated by a tab
display the postorder traversal of a binary tree in the same form as above
Write a function to display the inorder traversal of a binary tree and place a left parenthesis before each subtree and a right parenthesis after each subtree. Donâ€™t display anything for an empty subtree. For example, the expression tree should would be represented as (  (x)  + (  ( (y)*(a) )/(b)  )   )
